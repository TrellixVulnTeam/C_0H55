 * This program  illustrates the I/O techniques using an array named grades
 * defined to store five integers. Included within the program is two for loops.
 * The first for loop is used to cycle through each array element and allows  the 
 * user to input individual array values. The second for loop is used to display
 * the stored values.
 * 
 * In this program each element's value is accumulated in a total, which 
 * is displayed upon completion of the individual display of each array element.
