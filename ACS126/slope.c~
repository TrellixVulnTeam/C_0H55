 * -------------
 * This program calculates the slope of a line.
 * To calculate the slope of the line, the coordinate,
 * the values of the two end points of the line, must be known.
 * The user is prompted to input the coordinates values for the two
 * end points of the line. The value computed for the slope of the line 
 * printed. The output shows the input coordinate end points 
 * and the calculated value for the  the slope.
